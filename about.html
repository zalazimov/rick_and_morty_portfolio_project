        <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
        <p class="description">
          I'm Zalman Azimov, an aspiring Full Stack Developer and content
          creator. I am a loving father, passionate speaker, and also a huge fan
          of Rick and Morty. Although I haphazardly discovered coding, I
          instantly fell in love at first sight and have been excited about
          learning more about it ever since. I've always desired to utilize my
          love for math and formulas in a creative way, and software development
          has been the perfect outlet to channel those into. If you are curious
          to know more, you can reach me at zalmanazimov@pursuit.org.
